# Runner - ragequit 
 school project which i used to experience different disciplines in game development, and the practical implementation of each in a small simple game.

 Used unity and c#. Was extremely Interesting and i learnt what i found enjoyable and not.

 This is a very simple project you're free to enjoy.

 Cheers!
